plotsPlugin
===========

Plots plugin developed for the Arcane Survival server.

Author: "Morios" Mark Talrey

Current Version: RC.2 for Minecraft 1.7.10

Notes:
- Plot data is saved to "plots.ser" in the main server folder. This is serialized object data created by Java, and may not be human-readable.
- Currently saves on reload or server stop. I may add timed saves in at a later date.
- This version is definitely still a beta. It works, but may not be suitable for 'production' release.
- Next steps:
> config file
> integration with credits
